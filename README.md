### Hi, I’m Brendan.

I build deep tech at the intersection of biology, engineering and computer science between San Francisco and Brisbane, Australia.

In a past life I studied cosmology and galaxy formation at MIT while leading the [Caterpillar Project](https://www.caterpillarproject.org/), and was a contributor to the [Illustris Project](http://www.illustris-project.org/) at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard University.

I’m currently Chief Technology Officer and co-founder at [Dynomics Inc.](https://www.dynomics.com), a venture backed startup focused on reversing heart failure, deploying complex *in silico* and *in vitro* systems at the intersection of bioengineering, computer science, tissue engineering and cell biology.
